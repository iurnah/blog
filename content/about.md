This blog site is primarily to help myself to get better at my career by writing and possibly discussing with others computer science related topics. I am interested in algorithms, computer network and security, operating systems, distributed system, and machine learning. 

Of cause, I wish my writing can also benefit others.

This site is inspired by [Eli Bendersky's website](https://eli.thegreenplace.net), [Many But Finite](by://manybutfinite.com) by Gustavo Duarte, and [The Morning Paper](https://blog.acolyer.org) by Adrian Colyer. They are my models for writing computer science posts online. Please take a look at their articles.
