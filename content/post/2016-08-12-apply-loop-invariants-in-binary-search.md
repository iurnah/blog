When I read the book "Accelerated C++" years ago, I came across a systematic
description about the idea of loop invariants, which I found very interesting.
It open another door for me to think and solve some of the error prone programs
using binary search method.

Recently, I discovered a series of blog posts in Dr.Dobb's by the author of
"Accelerated C++", Andrew Koenig, discussing various problems using the idea of
loop invariants.  After read some of the post, I decide to note down how Mr.
Koenig apply this invaluable idea to various problems. Because I found it so
useful.
