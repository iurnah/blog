After the Visa lottery is a special moment. It's a big release. This is my third
time participate the lottery and I finally got it. Many things that are hung are
all rested with the single little receipt. From my experience of job hunting
since the begining of this year and all those hard moments I faced, I will take
this time to rebuild my work flow system. Basically, I want to give meself a
reset. I want say goodbey to many of my habits and thought pattern that not
worked well. I need a brand new start. There are 3 aspects I need to work on.

# Remove massive bookmarks
   1. firefox for work and code browse
   2. chrome for daily life
   3. should be updated based on the work at hand. (remove finished, add todo items)
  
__Usage principles:__

Use bookmark bar to keep a list of links that only related to your current work.
It should not be used as a container of websites that apears to be useful in
future without initial reading. When running into some interesting web page and
having the temptation to bookmark it, ask youself the following two questions: 

1. Am I going to use it in the next two weeks?
2. If so, will it be used in a daily basis?

If none of your answer to the above questions are positive, then gorget about it
and move on. If it is really useful, it will popup in your life again. Only at
that time you may find the answer to the questions become positive, so that you
can put it in your bookmark and prepare working on it then.

__Action:__

Everytime you finish a project or complete a large task, you should review your
bookmark, update it to reflect your need,  and make it the the most convenient.

# Organize file systems 

   1. Use Dropbox as the primary "file system"
   2. Use Drive to manage reference books and documents
   3. Backup data using portable SSD
   
The preference over Dropbox is because of its data backup and sync function, it
can ensure minimum chance of losing any important data I created, such as code or
writings. Store the books and documents in Drive will save lots of space in
Dropbox so that more project data can sit in Dropbox.

# Wiki, project, and blog
I use wiki to keep notes of all theoretical professional knowledge related to
computer science and personal development such as speaking and writing skills. 
Mediawiki is a complex system and there are some overhead in writing in wiki
format. When writing your wiki articles, don't waste time on the formatting,
write first with Markdown and then convert it to wiki text using Pan Doc tool.
Notice the content is the most important thing in the wiki, not the format and
the aesthetic.


I keep all my project source code in github and bitbucket. In this way, I
can create interest projects and work flow that encourage meself to write more
code and build strong engineering skills. I can use trello in bitbucket to track
my progress in a project. The reason that to use two service for projects is
that only bitbucket have private repository services, where I can keep my answer
to the Coursera assignment and homework problems private.

Other than that I should keep writing my blog. It left my foot-prints in the
internet space as well as may inspire others later who may need similar helps
like me. To achieve that I should focus on both the quality and quantity of the
post. This further requires me to explore more new, indepth technoloies and
meaningful things in my day to day work and learning. If I don't have much
interesting topic to cover in the post, I can look into the papers of the top
conferences such as OSDI or USENIX Security, and write paper reviews as blog posts.
